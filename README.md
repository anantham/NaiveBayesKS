# Naive Bayes Knowledge Session

This is an implementation of [Gaussian naive Bayes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_classifier#Gaussian_naive_Bayes) classifier. It has been tested on the [Iris flower data set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set).

## Required libraries

* matplotlib
* scipy
* seaborn

All of these are available on [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads)


## Running it

Run `jupyter notebook` in the directory that you clone this repo to, click on
the `Naive Bayes - Model.ipynb` file to open the notebook.

You can also view it on a [web browser][1] if you have a internet connection.
